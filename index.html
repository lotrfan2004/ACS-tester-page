        <h1>Thank you for joining the ACS (Audio Charting System) tester crew!</h1>
        <p>Click on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Bl2IsLYPyF5AktKvna0KgA-chDy3_Od?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this link</a> to download the latest .apk software package. Once downloaded, find the file in your android file system (usually your phone has a "files" app, where you can find the file, click on it, and say install).</p>
        <p>For feedback/questions please email or text me at <a href="mailto:10RNDavid22@gmail.com">10RNDavid22@gmail.com</a> or 347-855-4237â€¬. I am looking for as much feedback as possible, so please let me know what you think. Also, expect crashes etc as the app is still very early stage.</p>
        
        <h2>What is ACS?</h2>
        <p>The ACS is an audio charting system that allows nurses to chart using only their voice. The ACS takes in audio recordings which are meant to be recorded while a nurse provides patient care (do not use on the job yet, due to HIPAA compliance). No matter how disorganized, it organizes them into clear sections such as assessment data, patient care, intake and output, etc. This allows nurses to record EVERYTHING they do without ever logging into a computer, or hunting through flowsheets.</p>
        <p>To record, simply hit the record button and say "I am entering room XXX" and then simply say all of your assessment findings out loud- and the AI will organize it very intelligently. Give it a try!</p>
